Mrs. Sage's original gift for the Foundation of $10 million was increased in 1918 with a bequest of $5 million.\n\nThe mission of the Russell Sage Foundation is the \"improvement of social and living conditions in the United States of America.\" Mrs. Sage placed no restrictions on how this mission was to be fulfilled. She wished the scope of the Russell Sage Foundation to be national, but also requested that special attention be paid to New York City and its environs.\n\nThe Russell Sage Foundation received the largest single gift made by Mrs. Sage but she dispensed a total of $35 million between 1907 and her death in 1918. She made most of her contributions in the traditional manner of responding to individual solicitations on a case-by-case basis. Some institutions received a single large gift while others received, for several years, regular gifts of lesser amounts. Mrs. Sage also expressed her support of many organizations, mostly local, in a more symbolic way through gifts of $100 or less, lifetime memberships, or annual patronages.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1946, the Russell Sage Foundation focused its attention on improving the quality of living by exposing social problems and proposing and sponsoring practical solutions for those problems. The results of its investigations and field studies were presented in books, pamphlets and articles published by the Russell Sage Foundation.\n\nDuring this time the Foundation was organized by departments based on fields of research. Included among these departments were Charity Organization, Industrial Studies, Recreation, Surveys and Exhibits, and Statistics. The areas of study included, but were not limited to, public welfare, labor and industrial relations, regional planning, penology, child welfare, and the social work profession. The Russell Sage Foundation also supported existing social agencies and helped establish new agencies to serve previously neglected social concerns.\n\nIn 1948, due to declining financial investments and the gradual attrition of its staff, the Russell Sage Foundation underwent a philosophical and structural reorganization. It shifted its focus to basic research in the social and behavioral sciences and the strengthening of social welfare methodology. Structurally, it discontinued its specialized departments and created a coordinated central staff of professional personnel. Much of the work could then be carried out by individuals hired temporarily for specific projects. The Russell Sage Foundation presently continues in this role.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "8266e5f8e9a6afb0096bd023439bed2f", "publish": true, "label": "Biographical/Historical note", "type": "bioghist"}, {"type": "fileplan", "persistent_id": "d3f46720ca02b5398421ab26c788c70f", "subnotes": [{"content": "Former Classification: VI", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "publish": true}, {"subnotes": [{"content": "Oversized Material; Card Files; 35 mm Film; Annual Reports; and Newsletters.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "6b948fcd29fb4535de2e3c64ef112693", "publish": true, "label": "Related Archival Materials note", "type": "relatedmaterial"}, {"type": "userestrict", "persistent_id": "d31d38626063aff930e5c1cd1fc49ed4", "subnotes": [{"content": "RAC users must abide by all applicable provisions of United States copyright law.
