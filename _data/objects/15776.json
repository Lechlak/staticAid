At age 30, Mr. Grant opened his first \"W. T. Grant Co. 25 Cent Store\" in Lynn, Massachusetts with $1,000 he had saved from his work as a salesman. The W. T. Grant stores, specializing in retail sales of small household wares, were earning almost $100 million a year in sales by 1936, the same year that Mr. Grant started the Grant Foundation. By the time Mr. Grant passed away in 1972, at age 96, his nationwide empire of W. T. Grant Stores had grown to almost 1,200.  Just two years later, in 1974, the W.T. Grant Company declared bankruptcy.  The Foundation rebounded from a significant reduction in assets during this same period, and by the mid-1980s, the Foundation had amassed $130 million in assets.\n\nMr. Grant\u2019s lifetime of philanthropic work began with the incorporation of the Grant Foundation on October 29, 1936.  His goals for the Foundation were to support long-term approaches in social science research aimed at the understanding and prevention of the root causes of suffering and social problems. In his mind, the object of which was \"the enrichment of life, with a primary interest in people and in their adjustment to the world in which they live.\" \n\nMr. Grant went on to become Chairman of the Board of the W. T. Grant Company, President of the Grant Foundation, and later Chairman of the Foundation\u2019s Board. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Bates College in Maine in 1947 and the University of Miami in 1960. He received the Jacob Marley Award for service to mankind in 1957 and the first Clifford W. Beers Memorial Award for distinguished mental health service from the World Federation for Mental Health in 1965.\n\nMr. Grant retired from both the W. T. Grant Company and the Grant Foundation at age 90, yet still served in an honorary capacity until his death. The Foundation lives on in perpetuity, carrying out Mr. Grant's vision for programs and research that enable people \"to live more contentedly and peaceably, well in body and mind.\" ", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "publish": true}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/15776", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 0}
