The Council's lobbying efforts, including its response to the Tax Reform Act of 1969, are documented in the correspondence of Council executives David F. Freeman, Robert F. Goheen, and Eugene C. Struckhoff with politicians, members, and tax consultants that will be found throughout the series. Approximately 20 percent of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 dealt directly with foundations. The act, which extended and intensified Internal Revenue Service supervision of foundations and helped eliminate what some perceived as abuses in the management of foundations, had serious effects on foundations and on philanthropic giving. Files in this series discuss the impact or potential impact of changes in such areas as net investment income, self-dealing, excise taxes, and income accumulation regulations. Information on Internal Revenue Code revisions and the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 can also be found in this series.\n\nAlso housed here are files that offer insights into the Council's relationship with Congress. These files contain copies of proposed legislation in the House of Representatives and in the Senate; transcripts of House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee hearings; and correspondence with various members of Congress. Also included in the congressional files is a folder titled \"Investigations of Foundations\" (box 7, folder 61) that contains printed material regarding a number of congressional investigative committees, including the Special Committee to Investigate Tax Exempt Foundations (commonly known as the Reece Committee), whose chairman attempted in 1953-1954 to link foundations with the financing of communism in the United States.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "0486c21bcefb80b6cfbdc5128c0b5648", "publish": true, "label": "Scope and Contents note", "type": "scopecontent"}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/36441", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 0}
