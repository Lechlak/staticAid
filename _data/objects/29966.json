While the Fund's original resolve to aid Liberia in the same manner proved unfruitful, the Republic of Togo also became a beneficiary of this program in a minor way.\n\nUnder the limits established by the Fund, the West Africa Program did not operate as a grant-making agency. At the request of ministries in one of the African governments involved or of a private group of investors and industrialists, the Fund contracted with outside consultants to prepare \"feasibility studies.\" Each of these studies dealt in depth with a specific aspect of the concerned nation's economic potential or needs and was designed to provide a realistic framework for later action. The Fund's responsibility ended with the submission of these studies to the appropriate agencies or private groups.\n\nThe Program's main office in Lagos, Nigeria was also a distribution point for these studies. Its director, Robert I. Fleming, acted as a liaison between the governments of Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria and groups of U.S. investors. The Lagos office organized investigative tours for these investors and arranged their contacts with governmental personnel.\n\nThe West Africa Program of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was concluded at the end of 1962.\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "7d408461439f52065a0f8a0b41e62276", "publish": true, "label": "Biographical/Historical note", "type": "bioghist"}, {"subnotes": [{"content": "The records of the West Africa Program include correspondence from the New York and Lagos offices, memoranda, reports, administrative and financial materials, personnel correspondence, and a complete set of feasibility studies contracted by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
