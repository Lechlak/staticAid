The first, Council history, includes timelines and other material that document the formation of the Council (and its predecessor organizations) and its history. Also included in this section is material on the Council's proposed merger with the Foundation Center. The merger was discussed for a number of years prior to the recommendation put forth in the 1970 report of the Committee on the Foundation Field (also known as the Gardner Committee, after its chairman, John W. Gardner). The purpose of this ad hoc committee, which was formed in response to the Tax Reform Act of 1969, was to delineate and examine services and functions that needed to be provided to and for the foundation field; and to recommend an organizational structure for the field. Although the merger did not occur, the Council and the Foundation Center did work out a number of agreements, eliminating overlap and duplication of effort on the part of the two organizations. This series also includes correspondence, memos, and speeches of Landrum R. Bolling, chief executive officer of the Council, who wrote and spoke extensively on the need for a comprehensive public policy to encourage private philanthropy. An eclectic group of subject files concludes this series. Of note is a copy of the abovementioned Gardner Committee report (box 15, folder 131).\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "0854d55e908a9419b7bb7af5bf93354e", "publish": true, "label": "Scope and Contents note", "type": "scopecontent"}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/36556", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 2}
