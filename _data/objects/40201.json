Using publicly distributed statistics, this pioneering effort to develop a measurable \"State of the Child\" included child-rearing, income distribution, and services provided by public and voluntary institutions. The emphasis was placed upon what was termed as \"applied social indicators\" to answer questions regarding the success of school reading programs, health services, children's safety during that time and in the decade or two prior to the study. Program \"monitors\" in place attempted to recommend improvements in services through monitoring, particularly the child health stations, public school attendance program, food programs in the public schools, and school bilingual programs.
