The Commission was established through the initiative of John D. Rockefeller 3rd with the support and encouragement of House Ways and Means chairman Wilbur Mills; Treasury Secretary William Simon; and former Treasury Secretary George Schultz. The chairman of the Commission was John H. Filer, chairman of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Company. Aetna, John D. Rockefeller 3rd, and the Ford Foundation each contributed $25,000 to get the Commission started. Eventually the Commission raised over $2 million to fund its efforts. The Filer Commission sponsored numerous research studies by scholars in disciplines such as health, education, religion, law, and sociology. This series contains correspondence between members of the Council and the Commission, as well as drafts of the Council's report and recommendations to the Commission; copies of a number of Commission-sponsored studies; and a summary of the Commission's final published report. (Both the final report, \"Giving in America: Toward a Stronger Voluntary Sector,\" and the five-volume \"Research Papers\" published by the Department of the Treasury are available in the Archive Center library.)\n\n", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "persistent_id": "f8352087226a6451933fd201d9668792", "publish": true, "label": "Scope and Contents note", "type": "scopecontent"}], "uri": "/repositories/2/archival_objects/36519", "last_modified_by": "admin", "restrictions_apply": false, "position": 1}
