This research focused on the synthetic, analytical, and inorganic problems in chemical warfare and B\u20134 toxicity, especially mustard gases. This series consists primarily of correspondence, receipts, and forms tracking the routine exchange and use of scientific reports. Correspondence with other scientists also documents the exchange of samples, as well as directions for specific tests, preparations of samples, and brief discussions of reactions and test results. Also included is a significant amount of correspondence and forms related to the Espionage Act Oaths of Secrecy and Selective Service deferments for the scientists working in Bergmann's laboratory. The Literature files consist of reports and reprints from other scientists, along with Bergmann's handwritten notes about what he read. Also included in this series is an incomplete set of Administrative Circulars and Office Memorandum documenting the policies and procedures of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the National Defense Research Committee. The majority of memos are located in Box 5, but some are filed alphabetically by subject throughout the series.\n\nEight folders in this series have a correlating folder with the same title in series 5: Declassified Reports, the contents of which were declassified by the U.S. Army after this collection was archivally processed.
